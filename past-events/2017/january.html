            <h1>NodeSchool YQR</h1>
            <strong>January 14th, 2017</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            After a week of treacherous winter weather, the weekend of the second NodeSchool YQR was warmly welcomed by everyone.
            The day was beautiful and sunny… in other words, a perfect day for learning JavaScript and Node.js!
          </p>
          <p>
            Forty people had registered for January 14th’s NodeSchool YQR, and on the day, thirty-five people came out to work on nodeschool.io workshoppers, participate in lightning talks, and meet new friends in Regina’s developer community.
          </p>

          <p>
            The day started off at 1PM with a brief welcome spiel by none other than <a href="https://github.com/normrider2001" target="_blank">Craig N.</a>,
            NodeSchool YQR Mentor and Staff Database Developer at GasBuddy, and quickly transitioned into a quiet afternoon of independent and purpose-driven learning.
            If any attendee had a question or encountered a stumbling block, four NodeSchool mentors were at the ready to help out.
          </p>

          <p>
            At 2:30PM, <strong>Craig N.</strong> hosted a lightning talk for JavaScript and Node.js Beginners about Github.
            Eight people checked it out, and were quickly briefed about Git, GHPages, and everything in between.
            <strong>Adam B.</strong>, NodeSchool YQR Mentor and JavaScript Consultant at Bitovi, lead the second and final lightning talk of the day at 3:00PM.
            Sixteen people joined Adam to find out what is up and coming in the world of JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            The day wrapped up around 4PM, and while our mentors were sad to see everyone go, we were extremely happy with the turnout.
            There was great conversation generated by in-depth and perceptive questions, and we hope to continue that conversation at the next NodeSchool YQR.
            We’ll keep you posted, but we hope to plan our next NodeSchool in and around end of March / early April!
