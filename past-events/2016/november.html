      <h1>NodeSchool YQR - November 2016</h1>
      <small>November 19th, 2016</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first ever NodeSchool Regina (aka. NodeSchool YQR) had a good turnout.
      We had 40 people sign up prior to the event.
      We ended up having 27 people attend with 7 mentors and the workshop ran from 1-4 PM.
    </p>
    <p>
      We promoted the event through meetup.com, a Facebook event and we built our own site using GitHub pages.
      We also put posters up around the GasBuddy office and on campus.
      We also used GasBuddyâ€™s social media channels to promote the event.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the start, <a href="https://github.com/normrider2001" target="_blank">Craig</a> gave a 10 minute presentation explaining the format of NodeSchool.
      He also did a brief walkthrough with the first lesson in the Javascripting workshop.
      Since it was the first time, we broke the workshops into three levels:
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>Beginners (non programmers):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jsforcats.com" target="_blank">jsforcats.com</a> - website</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting" target="_blank">Javascripting</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>People that know Javascript, but not node:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode" target="_blank">Learn You Node</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/npm/how-to-npm" target="_blank">How to npm</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>People that know node:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/elementary-electron" target="_blank">Elementary Electron</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks" target="_blank">ExpressWorks</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this was the first NodeSchool meetup in Regina, most people were either working on <a href="https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting" target="_blank">Javascripting</a> or <a href="https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode" target="_blank">Learn You Node</a>.
      We also found there was a pretty good mix of novice and experienced programmers, and most participants came with their environments already set up.
      We had tried to arrange participants at the different tables according to their skill/familiarity level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our sponsor was <a href="https://gasbuddy.com" target="_blank">GasBuddy</a>, who provided the venue, the snacks, the stickers and most of the mentors, all of whom were current or former GasBuddy employees.
