            <p>
              <a href="https://nodeschool.io" target="_blank">NodeSchool</a> is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events.
              It began in 2013 in Silicon Valley, and has since expanded to become a community of over 170 chapters worldwide; more than 600 events have been held on every continent besides Antarctica. NodeSchool YQR is the first such workshop to be held in Regina, and the 5th to be held in Canada.

            <h3 class="section-title">What can I expect at NodeSchool YQR?</h3>
            <p>
              At each workshop, participants will work through interactive tutorials or “workshoppers” that teach programming languages like JavaScript and Node.js.
              The tutorials are self-guided, but experienced mentors are always on hand to help you through any questions.
              When you come, you can expect to spend an afternoon with like-minded individuals in the Regina tech community who are there to hang out and learn.
              Previous coding experience is helpful, but not necessary!

          <h3 class="section-title">Before you come...</h3>
          <p>We want to make sure everyone who comes to NodeSchool gets the most out of it, so here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
          <p class="que">Never done code before - no HTML or CSS or Excel formulas?</p>
          <p class="ans">
            You should at least have a text editor (notepad, notepad++, Atom etc.) and be able to open your command line tool (Command Prompt, Powershell, Git Bash ot Terminal).<br / />
            If you're looking to get up to speed on the command line,
            read the first 8 chapters of <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn CLI the Hard Way</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="que">Do I need anything to attend this event?</p>
          <p class="ans">
            You will need a laptop.
            If you have any special needs or any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:cgrumbly@gasbuddy.com">Chelsea Grumbly</a>.</p>
          <p class="que">Workshop Preparation</p>
          <p class="ans">
            You should <a href="http://nodejs.org">install node</a> before you come.<br />
            Once you install it, open command line and run "node -v" command to print the version of node installed on your machine.<br />
            Also try "npm -v" to verify that npm was installed with node like it should have been.
          </p>
          <p class="que">Anything else?</p>
          <p class="ans">
            It would be great if you could install the course you plan to work on during the event.<br/>
