## What is NodeSchool?

[**NodeSchool**](http://nodeschool.io) is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events.

It began in 2013 in Silicon Valley, and has since expanded to become a community of over 170 chapters worldwide; more than 600 events have been held on every continent besides Antarctica.

## What can I expect at NodeSchool YQR?

At each workshop, participants will work through interactive tutorials or “workshoppers” that teach programming languages like JavaScript and Node.js. The tutorials are self-guided, but experienced mentors are always on hand to help you through any questions. When you come, you can expect to spend an afternoon with like-minded individuals in the Regina tech community who are there to hang out and learn. Previous coding experience is helpful, but not necessary!
